# mini-project2

## Description
The file includes a project of a webpage that will allow the user to see snippets of code. Through this the user will gain a better understanding of what the code looks like when in a stylesheet. The completed application should meet the following criteria:

* As a user, I can view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.

* As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.

* As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.

* As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.

### Installations

* IDE capable of running HTML and CSS

* Windows 10 or similar operating system

### Step

* Fork and clone the repository through github.
* Open in your choice of IDE and then open into a Web browser to view the webpage.

This gives you a view of the finished product.
